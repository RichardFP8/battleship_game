# battleship_game

A failed attempt based on the actual boardgame 'battleship'

## Human.py

Functions defined to receive user input and use it to build their ships

## Computer.py

Functions defined to make x ships(x is received by user when prompted how many ships to create) at random positions

## shared.py (could be a better name?)

Two functions that are used in both human.py and computer.py. The (1)validation of ships and (2)printing the ships in a 'battlefield' (23x48)

## main.py

Call the main functions of both human.py and computer.py. As of 6/16/2023 they work as expected (individually)

**NOT COMPLETE YET**

Next steps:
- **Human.py and Computer.py work together** (actually play the game) _HOW DIFFICULT: YES_
- Add visuals to let users know where they're choosing their coordinates
- Make rules more clearer and give option to refer back to them
